            <h2>welcome to my digital treehouse :)</h2>
            <p>i always wanted a treehouse, the kind children's book characters had,
            decorated in crayon drawings and maps and strange flower collections.
            here is a digital recreation of some things i would have had on my walls.
            you'll find a collection of my artistic endeavors to your right and other things
            enjoy while you're here!</p>
